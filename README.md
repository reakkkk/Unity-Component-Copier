# Unity Component Copier

A Unity Editor tool to copy components from one GameObject to another ‚Äì excluding `Transform`.  
Includes an advanced Smart Override Mode that remaps object references between hierarchies.  

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Copy all components from a source GameObject to a target GameObject (except `Transform`)
- Preview which components will be copied before applying
- Select/deselect individual components
- Option to overwrite existing components of the same type, or add them as new
- Include or skip disabled components
- **Smart Override Mode**:
  - Copies values and remaps object references from the source hierarchy to the target hierarchy by relative path
  - Keeps existing references when no match is found to avoid broken links

## üí° Example Use Cases
- Duplicate a prefab setup with all its scripts and serialized values
- Replace an old GameObject with a new one while preserving its components
- Quickly clone setup-heavy GameObjects without manual reference assignment

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- `Transform` and `RectTransform` are never copied
- Smart Override Mode relies on hierarchy paths. If the target hierarchy differs, unmatched references will remain unchanged
